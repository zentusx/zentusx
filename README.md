Hi! I'm zentus. I'm a cambodian game developer in Roblox and Unreal Engine, Mainly an intermediate viewmodel animator in Blender and a typescript-luau programmer.

I first got into game development since 2018, But i didn't have a computer back then, I've only been programming games for about 9 months, and i also cube.

My main focus and goal of 2024 is to make a functioning arcade first person shooter.
